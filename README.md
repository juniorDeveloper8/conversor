## üêç Summary üêç

This Java Application consists of three JFrame forms that provide different functionalities to the user. The first form is the Menu, where available options are presented. The second form is the Dollars and Euros Converter, allowing the user to convert an amount of money between dollars and euros. The third form is the Celsius and Fahrenheit Converter, enabling the user to convert a temperature between degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit.
